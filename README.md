# <u>happy-x-covid</u> 📊

Using the numpy, pandas, beautiful soup and sklearn libraries, 
I webscrapped data on from several sources such as: **Worldometer, John Hopkins University CSSEGIS, 2021 World Happiness Report** to provide a Data set on countries ranked by happiness with information on their population and COVID-19

Throughout my STAT 231 course I will be using the taught principles of data analysis to draw my own conclusions on the extracted data.
