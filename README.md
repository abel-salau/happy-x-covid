# happy-x-covid

Using the numpy, pandas, beautiful soup and sklearn libraries, 
I webscrapped data on from several sources such as: 
-Worldometer
-John Hopkins CSSEGIS
World Happiness Report 

to provide a Data set on countries ranked by happiness with
information on their population and COVID-19 where throughout my enrollment in my Statistics
course I will be using the taught principles of data analysis to draw my own conclusions on the extracted data
